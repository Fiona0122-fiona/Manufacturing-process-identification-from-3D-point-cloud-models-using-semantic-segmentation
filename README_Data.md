# Data used in manufacturing process identification from 3D point cloud models using semantic segmentation

Despite recent developments in deep learning, there remains a scarcity of 3D CAD model datasets specifically tailored to manufacturing processes. To address this gap, we generated a dataset that incorporates geometric features associated with three primary manufacturing processes: casting, turning, and milling. This dataset includes both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric 3D CAD models of industrially relevant parts sourced from GrabCAD, featuring part types such as Axle, Fish Bracket, Casting Component, Pump Cover, Engine Shaft, Flanged Shaft, Keyed Transmission Shaft, and Stepped Shaft, as illustrated in Fig. 1. A key challenge in this domain is the ambiguity in identifying the exact manufacturing processes for specific features, as there is often no direct correspondence between geometry and manufacturing processes, particularly for complex or interactive features.
