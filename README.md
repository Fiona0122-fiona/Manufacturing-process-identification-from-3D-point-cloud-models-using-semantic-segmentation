## Installation
This repo provides the MRIConv++ and PRIConv++ source codes, which had been tested with Python 3.9.7, PyTorch 1.9.0, CUDA 11.1 on Ubuntu 20.04. Our codes are implemented based on Zhi Yuan Zhang's Pytorch implementation of [ RIConv++(https://github.com/cszyzhang/riconv2)], Xu Yan's [PointNet++(Pytorch)](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch) and ShaoShuai Shi's [PointNet++ cuda operations](https://github.com/sshaoshuai/Pointnet2.PyTorch).  

Install the pointnet++ cuda operation library by running the following command:
```
cd models/pointnet2/
python setup.py install
cd ../../
```

## Usage


### Segmentation
We perform semantic segmentation on mriconv2_3d and priconv2_3d respectively. mriconv2_3d and priconv2_3d are new datasets generated. 

```
####  mriconv2_3d
The mriconv2_3d dataset has been uploaded, including NumPy (.npy) files and raw CAD models in SLDPRT and STL formats.

```
cd data_utils
python collect_indoor3d_data.py
```
Processed data will save in `../data/s3dis/stanford_indoor3d/`. (**Note**: the `data/` folder is outside the project folder)

Training:
```
python3 train_semseg.py
```
For testing, you can use your trained model by specifying `--log_dir` or use our **pretrained model** [18.2MB](log/sem_seg/pretrained) directly:
```
python3 test_semseg.py
```
