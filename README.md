## Installation
This repo provides the MRIConv++ and PRIConv++ source codes, which had been tested with Python 3.9.7, PyTorch 1.9.0, CUDA 11.1 on Ubuntu 20.04. Our codes are implemented based on Zhi Yuan Zhang's Pytorch implementation of [ RIConv++(https://github.com/cszyzhang/riconv2)], Xu Yan's [PointNet++(Pytorch)](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch) and ShaoShuai Shi's [PointNet++ cuda operations](https://github.com/sshaoshuai/Pointnet2.PyTorch).  

Install the pointnet++ cuda operation library by running the following command:
```
cd models/pointnet2/
python setup.py install
cd ../../
```

## Usage


### Segmentation
We perform semantic segmentation on mriconv2_3d and priconv2_3d respectively.

If you want to process your own data, please use:
```
cd data_utils
python collect_indoor3d_data.py
```

Processed data (for MRIConv++) save in `../data/s3dis/mriconv2_3d/`. (**Note**: the `data/` folder is outside the project folder). The processed data can be download at :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zl6MU-Hb4J0Pdcn-pcOJd2XyILgOBbKH/view?usp=drive_link.

Processed data (for PRIConv++)save in `../data/s3dis/priconv2_3d/`. (**Note**: the `data/` folder is outside the project folder).

The raw data (sldprt,stl and txt all provided) are in the folder "CAD Model Data".They can be download at :

Training:

```
python3 train_semseg.py
```
For testing, you can use your trained model by specifying `--log_dir` or use our **pretrained model** (log/sem_seg/pretrained) directly:

```
python3 test_semseg.py
```
